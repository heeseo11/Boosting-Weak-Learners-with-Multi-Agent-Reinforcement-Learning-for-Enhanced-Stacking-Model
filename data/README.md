## Physiological and Behavioural dataset for Human Emotions (PPB-Emo)

This project utilizes the publicly available PPB-Emo dataset, which includes data capturing psychological, physiological, and behavioral responses during driving tasks. The following three types of data were used in this work:

- Psychological_data
- Physiological_data
- Driving_behavioural_data

For more details, refer to the following paper:

[Li, Wenbo, et al. "A multimodal psychological, physiological and behavioural dataset for human emotions in driving tasks." *Scientific Data* 9.1 (2022): 481.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01557-2)

You can download the PPB-Emo dataset from the following link:

The training data is generated by gathering the prediction values from each individual model's vanilla model(ex.v_LR) and the tuned model(ex.LR).
Each number represents the label predicted by the model when classifying emotions. The category represents the ground truth label, and the participant refers to the experiment participant.
The test data follows the same format, and the code can be found at the link below.
