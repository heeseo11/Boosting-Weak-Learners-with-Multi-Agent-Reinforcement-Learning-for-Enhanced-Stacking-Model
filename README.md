## Agent Definition
Agents are defined as $AG_{n}$, with each agent representing one of the 12 individual models in the stacking model.

## Action Definition
Each agent in the stacking model has two actions for model selection: selecting a model (1) and not selecting a model (0). These actions are represented as $A_{t-1}$ for past cases and $A_{t}$ for current cases, with rewards granted for different actions.

## Reward Definition

The reward system in this study, defined as $F1_{delta}$, reflects the performance change before and after each episode. Weaker learners receive higher rewards through additional weights, while stronger learners get less. The final reward is adjusted based on action changes, maintaining a balance between strong and weak learners.
